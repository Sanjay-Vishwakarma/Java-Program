The interface called Deque is present in java.util package. It is the subtype of the interface queue.
The Deque supports the addition as well as the removal of elements from both ends of the data structure.
Therefore, a deque can be used as a stack or a queue. We know that the stack supports the Last In First Out (LIFO) operation,
 and the operation First In First Out is supported by a queue. As a deque supports both, either of the mentioned operations can be performed on it.
 Deque is an acronym for "double ended queue".
