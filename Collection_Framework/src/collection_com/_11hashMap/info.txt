Java HashMap class implements the Map interface which allows us to store key and value pair, where keys should be unique.
 If you try to insert the duplicate key, it will replace the element of the corresponding key.
 It is easy to perform operations using the key index like updation, deletion, etc. HashMap class is found in the java.util package.

HashMap in Java is like the legacy Hashtable class, but it is not synchronized. It allows us to store the null elements as well,
but there should be only one null key. Since Java 5, it is denoted as HashMap<K,V>, where K stands for key and V for value.
It inherits the AbstractMap class and implements the Map interface.



Points to remember

    Java HashMap contains values based on the key.
    Java HashMap contains only unique keys.
    Java HashMap may have one null key and multiple null values.
    Java HashMap is non synchronized.
    Java HashMap maintains no order.
    The initial default capacity of Java HashMap class is 16 with a load factor of 0.75.

Hierarchy of HashMap class :

            As shown in the above figure, HashMap class extends AbstractMap class and implements Map interface.

What is Hashing

It is the process of converting an object into an integer value. The integer value helps in indexing and faster searches.
What is HashMap

HashMap is a part of the Java collection framework. It uses a technique called Hashing. It implements the map interface.
It stores the data in the pair of Key and Value. HashMap contains an array of the nodes, and the node is represented as a class.
It uses an array and LinkedList data structure internally for storing Key and Value. There are four fields in HashMap.
Working of HashMap in Java

Before understanding the internal working of HashMap, you must be aware of hashCode() and equals() method.

    equals(): It checks the equality of two objects. It compares the Key, whether they are equal or not. It is a method of the Object class. It can be overridden. If you override the equals() method, then it is mandatory to override the hashCode() method.
    hashCode(): This is the method of the object class. It returns the memory reference of the object in integer form. The value received from the method is used as the bucket number. The bucket number is the address of the element inside the map. Hash code of null Key is 0.
    Buckets: Array of the node is called buckets. Each node has a data structure like a LinkedList. More than one node can share the same bucket. It may be different in capacity.

Insert Key, Value pair in HashMap

We use put() method to insert the Key and Value pair in the HashMap. The default size of HashMap is 16 (0 to 15).
