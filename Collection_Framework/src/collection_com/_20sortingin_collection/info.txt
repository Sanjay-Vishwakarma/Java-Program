 We can sort the elements of:

    String objects
    Wrapper class objects
    User-defined class objects

Collections class provides static methods for sorting the elements of a collection. If collection elements are of a Set type, we can use TreeSet.
However,
we cannot sort the elements of List. Collections class provides methods for sorting the elements of List type elements.
